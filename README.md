# WASM MASM x86 Editor

WASM MASM x86 Editor is a portable x86 Microsoft Assembly Language (MASM) code compiler, linker, runner and editor packaged with the [Irvine Library](http://asmirvine.com/)

This app is made possible through the use of [JWlink and JWasm](https://github.com/JWasm) to compile x86/x64 MASM and a 32-bit wine terminal to execute x86 executable binaries using [Boxedwine](http://www.boxedwine.org/) emscripten port. The text editor functionality is provided by [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
